You can use the feature by filling in the data, or leave it blank if you do not want to display it.

### Show Table of Contents: 

You can click disable if you don't want to display the table of contents in the article sidebar.

### Custom Icon Author: 

If you want to use a custom icon for the author, then you can fill in the custom icon, upload the icon and enter your site url. By using a custom icon, you can empty the area on the author profile icon - because it has been replaced with a custom icon.
