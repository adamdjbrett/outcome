    "abstract": "Perkinson discusses the origins of colonialism and white supremacy, tracing it back to the relationship with the land. He explores the shift from pastoral-nomad lifeways to city-state agriculture, leading to a myth of cultivar sovereignty and Christian supremacy. He argues that white supremacy is rooted in a myth of mastery over the non-human world, with a focus on urban-centered control of land. He highlights the resistance of pastoral nomad traditions against city-state coercion and the importance of a respectful land-based symbiosis. Furthermore, he stresses that the deep historical taproot of white supremacy implies a particular relationship to land centered in cities, supported by farmlands, and ultimately leading to the enslavement of both land and non-humankind.",
