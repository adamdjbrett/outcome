	abstract = {Mendoza contends that racism in the Philippines is the bastard child of the union between colonial Christianity and civilizational supremacy. Now largely secularized, its most overt manifestation may be said to be in state policy toward the country's indigenous populations. Ironically, despite the enactment into law in 1997 of some of the most progressive protections for the rights of indigenous peoples, the foreclosures around land-based, subsistence ways of living manifests the prejudice. As such, the only allowable mode of relation vis-Ã -vis the state's indigenous populations remains assimilationist, celebrating "otherness" in cultural expression for tourism purposes contributing to GDP, but sanctioning and punishing any kindred political advocacy for land and life.},
