The church commits to undoing the ongoing evils of the Doctrine of Discovery and building right relationships with indigenous nations. The Upstate New York Synod confesses and repents for its complicity in the harm done to indigenous peoples and strives to strengthen anti-oppression efforts for justice and equity.",
