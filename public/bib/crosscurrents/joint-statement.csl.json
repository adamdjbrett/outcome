    "abstract": "The Catholic Church strives to promote universal fraternity and respect for the dignity of every human being, condemning acts of violence, oppression, and social injustice. While acknowledging past wrongs committed against indigenous peoples, the Church is committed to reconciliation, healing, and promoting the rights and cultural values of all individuals. The Church rejects the concept of the \"doctrine of discovery\" and upholds the inherent human rights of indigenous peoples, supporting principles outlined in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.",
