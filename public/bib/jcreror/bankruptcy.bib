More specifically, would such an approach be in line with the worldviews of the Indigenous peoples potentially affected by such conservation or development? We&amp;amp;nbsp;consider these questions both legally and theologically. We acknowledge that the protection of human rights is better than their violation, but we also take seriously critiques of this standard human rights discourse. We argue that case studies such as Oak Flat, Lake Titicaca, and the Klamath River call us away from abstract affirmations of the human right to religious freedom and toward a rights-of-nature framework – even as we consider critiques of this framework as well. Ultimately, both Western legal discourse and Western religious studies discourse reduce Indigenous cosmologies (which are metaphysical systems) into cultural debates, thus erasing the sovereignty of Indigenous lands and peoples. A decolonizing approach therefore requires a rethinking of the sacred.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, number={2}, journal={Journal of the Council for Research on Religion}, author={Titizano, Cecilia and Lloyd, Dana}, year={2024}, month={Nov.}, pages={58–74} }
