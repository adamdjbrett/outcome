This website is the official archive of the outcome publications from the Henry J. Luce Foundation Grant Funded project **“200 Years of Johnson v. M’Intosh (JvM): Indigenous Responses to the Religious Foundations of Racism"**. Professor [Philip P. Arnold](https://artsandsciences.syracuse.edu/people/faculty/arnold-philip-p/) was the PI on this project which ran from 2022-2024. Project activities included a [conference](https://doctrineofdiscovery.org/blog/conference-schedule/), [podcasts](/podcasts), and various types of publications. 

## Summary
“200 Years of Johnson v. M’Intosh (JvM): Indigenous Responses to the Religious Foundations of Racism,” is a collaborative initiative made possible through relationships developed over 30 years between academic and Indigenous communities. At its core, the project seeks to interrogate and critically examine connections between the [Doctrine of Christian Discovery (DOCD)](https://doctrineofdiscovery.org/what-is-the-doctrine-of-discovery/), the Catholic Papal Bulls that undergird the [Doctrine](https://doctrineofdiscovery.org), and the Doctrine’s pernicious influence on United States Indian Law today.

The 200th anniversary of JvM provides an excellent moment to challenge the theology and jurisprudence of [DOCD](https://doctrineofdiscovery.org/what-is-the-doctrine-of-discovery/) and this critical Supreme Court decision. The project will deliver a range of digital products and written works combined with a host of public outreach activities to raise awareness about the harmful impacts of the [DOCD](https://doctrineofdiscovery.org/what-is-the-doctrine-of-discovery/) and provide support for a global movement of Indigenous People’s that seek to repudiate it.
