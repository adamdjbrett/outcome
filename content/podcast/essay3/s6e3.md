## Episode Themes
- Dominionist readings of Genesis 1:28 fueled the Doctrine of Discovery, witch burnings, and modern domination systems; the episode surfaces Indigenous and ecofeminist correctives.
- Haudenosaunee fire stewardship and creation stories foreground the agency of the natural world and reciprocal relations with Earth.
- Wilderness experiences and ecofeminist theology as pathways to collaborative healing between men and women.
- Grappling with ancestral histories to understand present injustices and work toward a just future.
- Centering Indigenous values and wisdom to address socio-ecological crises and reorient dominant Christian traditions.
- Imagining "Earth as Mother God" as a theological frame to replace domination with relationship.
