### INTRODUCTION

We never strived to be your equalsOr fought for that sameness of identityThere was no reason for uprisingAgainst your anthropocentric prototyped patternForeseen long before your arrival    Because we had established equivalent equityMillennium prior to your pilgrimage of biblical conquestAnd your utopian misunderstanding of our communitiesAnd your fear of the unknown    We never wanted to be equalizedBy the progression of crookednessBent on the achievement of possession over allWe didn't fight for equalityWe fought as the land that fights to sustain all life possibleWe gave you the benefit of calling you brothers and sistersLong before you realised the understanding of balance    We gave you the opportunity to learn reciprocityAnd the accurate meaning of great peaceAs you continue to import oppression to gain profitWhile stumbling on the meaning of salvationWe never strived to be your equalsBecause by doing so we would have becomeYour illusion of mirrored imagery [End Page 416]     And in the first and final analysis that is not our callingWe aren't the outlaws of an imported democracyWe aren't the beneficiaries of a bewildered empireLost in its own infantile version of identity [End Page 417]
