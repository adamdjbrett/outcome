Instead of detailed book reviews, some journals publish book notes. Book notes tend to be shorter snapshots and encapsulated recent books within a particular field. Likewise, we seek to do the same thing here. In recent years, there has been an appreciable upswing in scholarly studies and analysis of topics related to what Shawnee/Lenape scholar Steven T.

Throughout the book, Arnold demonstrates how the Doctrine of Christian Discovery is the origin point for enslavement, exploitation, and extraction today. 1The Christian religious nationalism of the Doctrine of Christian Discovery then needs to be repudiated, rescinded, and dismantled to help stop the ecological crisis. Ideological domination and planetary dominion are...
