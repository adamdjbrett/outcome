### INTRODUCTION

It is a classic misinterpretation to refer to allNatives as always being in harmony withthemselves and their surroundings. As in,categorizing, denomination, caste, grade,order and grouping. With the above sentences in mind, I'll refer toonly my people's past.We weren't always at peace or in harmonywith ourselves and the earth. We struggledand fought with our own people. Wesuffered insult and reproach and turned toviolence in return for that insult and reproach. At one time, we were anything but united. Welived the epitome of survival.We needed guidance. Our understanding ofcreation was there in our minds. Our need tostop feuding was also there in our minds. Wewere on the brink of destruction to oursurroundings and ourselves. We were very much out of (harmony), andsome of the people knew it.Our feuding and disregard not only affected [End Page 400] our own peoples, but sent wavelengths ofdisregard to other (nations). Then something and someone came amongus and directed a change throughsuggestion and instruction. Not through lawand religion. Not through miracles of magic,and certainly, not through the "law" of nature. Imagine an outsider, coming into our feudingand proposing a great peace. Imagine, thathe understood our conflicts and distrustbecause they were generated and cast in alldirections reaching others who felt ourconflicts and distrust. Imagine, the vital and momentousundertaking that he decided to accept, tospeak and generate the language of a greatpeace. Centuries before the dogma of submissionknown as religion, arrived here on …Turtle Island. [End Page 401]
