### INTRODUCTION

I am the meadowAnd the tall grassesI am the stoneThat rolled awayI am the waterThat flows through all life possibleI am the treeThat shades, warms, and reaches deep and highI am the bee hiveThat ensures pollinationI am the saltOf the earth and the teardrops of relativesI am the rafter and foundationOf a place called homeI am the birdThat flies without propellingI am the chipmunkWho wears the Two Row on its backI am the sandThat bears the footprints of timeI am the earthThat quakes with no apologiesI am the seed [End Page 551] That the womb protectedI am a small strandIn the Web of All Life Possible [End Page 552]
