### INTRODUCTION

I am the meadow And the tall grasses I am the stone That rolled away I am the water That flows through all life possible I am the tree That shades, warms, and reaches deep and high I am the bee hive That ensures pollination I am the salt Of the earth and the teardrops of relatives I am the rafter and foundationOf a place called homeI am the bird That flies without propelling I am the chipmunk Who wears the Two Row on its back I am the sand That bears the footprints of time I am the earth That quakes with no apologiesI am the seed [End Page 551]
