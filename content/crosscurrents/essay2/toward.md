abstract: "The Church needs to make commitments to undo the damage of instilling white superiority beliefs. Churches worldwide can be part of a campaign to change the effects of domination and undo the belief in white superiority. Healing is needed between Indigenous people and those seeking reconciliation after a difficult history. Efforts are being made to address the effects of the boarding school era on Native families. Apologies have been made, but change is necessary. Steps towards healing and recovery include admitting harmful beliefs, sharing with others, releasing emotions, and resolving not to harm others in the future. Being an ally and speaking up against hatred and threats to Native people is important."
